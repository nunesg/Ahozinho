int __builtin_ffs (int x)
// Returns one plus the index of the least significant 1-bit of x, or if x is zero, returns zero.

int __builtin_clz (unsigned int x)
// Returns the number of leading 0-bits in x, starting at the most significant bit position. If x is 0, the result is undefined.

int __builtin_ctz (unsigned int x)
// Returns the number of trailing 0-bits in x, starting at the least significant bit position. If x is 0, the result is undefined.

int __builtin_clrsb (int x)
// Returns the number of leading redundant sign bits in x, i.e. the number of bits following the most significant bit that are identical to it. There are no special cases for 0 or other values.

int __builtin_popcount (unsigned int x)
// Returns the number of 1-bits in x.

int __builtin_parity (unsigned int x)
// Returns the parity of x, i.e. the number of 1-bits in x modulo 2.

int __builtin_ffsl (long)
// Similar to __builtin_ffs, except the argument type is long.

int __builtin_clzl (unsigned long)
// Similar to __builtin_clz, except the argument type is unsigned long.

int __builtin_ctzl (unsigned long)
// Similar to __builtin_ctz, except the argument type is unsigned long.

int __builtin_clrsbl (long)
// Similar to __builtin_clrsb, except the argument type is long.

int __builtin_popcountl (unsigned long)
// Similar to __builtin_popcount, except the argument type is unsigned long.

int __builtin_parityl (unsigned long)
// Similar to __builtin_parity, except the argument type is unsigned long.

int __builtin_ffsll (long long)
// Similar to __builtin_ffs, except the argument type is long long.

int __builtin_clzll (unsigned long long)
// Similar to __builtin_clz, except the argument type is unsigned long long.

int __builtin_ctzll (unsigned long long)
// Similar to __builtin_ctz, except the argument type is unsigned long long.

int __builtin_clrsbll (long long)
// Similar to __builtin_clrsb, except the argument type is long long.

int __builtin_popcountll (unsigned long long)
// Similar to __builtin_popcount, except the argument type is unsigned long long.

int __builtin_parityll (unsigned long long)
// Similar to __builtin_parity, except the argument type is unsigned long long.

double __builtin_powi (double, int)
// Returns the first argument raised to the power of the second. Unlike the pow function no guarantees about precision and rounding are made.

float __builtin_powif (float, int)
// Similar to __builtin_powi, except the argument and return types are float.

long double __builtin_powil (long double, int)
// Similar to __builtin_powi, except the argument and return types are long double.

uint16_t __builtin_bswap16 (uint16_t x)
// Returns x with the order of the bytes reversed; for example, 0xaabb becomes 0xbbaa. Byte here always means exactly 8 bits.

uint32_t __builtin_bswap32 (uint32_t x)
// Similar to __builtin_bswap16, except the argument and return types are 32 bit.

uint64_t __builtin_bswap64 (uint64_t x)
// Similar to __builtin_bswap32, except the argument and return types are 64 bit.
